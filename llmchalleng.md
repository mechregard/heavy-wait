Pezzo offers a range of challenges for LLM application development, including observability challenges, such as latency and cost monitoring, context reuse/uniqueness monitoring and feedback capture. It also requires observability tracing requests by an ID, identifying properties to observe, and metrics and filters on the properties. Lastly, in terms of orchestration, it provides the ability to request JSON output or use a functioncalling API to generate function input.

observability challenges
 - latency monitor
 - cost / token monitor
 - context reuse / uniqueness monitor
 - feedback capture for possible fine tuning or prompt few shot

observability requirements
 - tracing requests by some id
 - properties identified to observe
 - metrics and filters on properties

orchestration
 - request json output, or use funcioncalling api to generate fn input
